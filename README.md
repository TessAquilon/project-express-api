# Project Express API

Trans Rights Indicator Project (TRIP) API provides insight into the legal situations transgender people faced in 173 countries from 2000 to 2021. The dataset currently includes 14 indicators that capture the presence or absence of laws related to criminalization, legal gender recognition, and anti-discrimination protections.

## The problem

The problem was to create an Express API, using a provided dataset or a dataset of our choice. I found my dataset on Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/konradb/trans-rights-indicator-project/data and converted it to JSON using this nifty tool https://csvjson.com/.
